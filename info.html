    <h1>All about South Africa's Eletricity</h1>


    <p>
        Electricity prices in South Africa are quite high nationally. As a result, most people are careful when it comes to consumption. 
        Therefore, you might be curious to learn more about your consumption and whether you're getting your money's worth. 
        This article disproves the South African electricity cost estimate for 2023 and emphasizes practical techniques to cut back on consumption.

             <br>
             <p>
                More than 1,000 watts is the power rating of the majority of electrical appliances. 
                The power rating on an electric appliance dictates how much power the device consumes as it runs. As a result, 
                electrical power is expressed in kilowatts, or KW. 1000 watts make up one kilowatt.

         <br>
         <p>
            The rate at which electrical energy is supplied to a consumer is known as tariff. 
            The cost is determined per home based on the Eskom tariff and is expressed in cents per kilowatt-hour (c/kWh). 
            Higher prices apply to users who use more than 600 kWh than to users who use less than 600 kWh.

             <br>
             <p>
                By measuring the amount of power your appliances consume, you may determine your total KWh. 
                To find out how much energy your appliances use, consult the chart of <a href="https://letsavelectricity.com/wattage-power-consumption-of-household-appliances/" > typical appliance electricity usage.</a>

            letter-spacing: 4px;">How much does Eskom charge for 1 kWh? </p><br>
         <p>
            When purchasing Eskom's pre-paid power, a kWh equals one unit. The precise cost of a kWh is determined on things like one's home's price, municipality, 
            power provider, and current. From 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, the lowest Eskom rate was R1.61 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Due to variables including a consumer's 
            location and consumption patterns, Eskom's pricing structure and variances are complex. Depending on their typical use, city residents will receive up to 25 or
             60 units free under the 2022/2023 tariffs. Up to 350 monthly units are used at a cost of R1,80 (VAT included), whereas 350 to 450 monthly units are consumed at a cost of R3,63.
